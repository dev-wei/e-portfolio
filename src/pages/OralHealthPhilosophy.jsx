      <h2>Oral Health Philosophy Statement</h2>
      <p>
        I believe that oral health is an essential component of overall health and wellbeing. 
        My philosophy centers on preventive care, patient education, and minimally invasive 
        treatments when necessary.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I am committed to staying current with the latest research and techniques in dentistry, 
        ensuring that my patients receive the highest standard of care based on evidence-based 
        practices. I value building long-term relationships with my patients, founded on trust, 
        respect, and open communication.
